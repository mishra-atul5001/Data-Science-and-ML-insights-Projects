# Top ML Notebooks to Explore

1. # Students-Performance-in-Exams-Kaggle-
An EDA analysis and Categorization of Students Performance over given Data Set.
  We explore the Data Set with variations and Then perform ML Algorithms on it to predict different Accuracies.

2. # Credit Card Fraud Detection Analysis
A visualization performed towards credit card fraud detection with reducing the size of the Data Set and performing Isolation Forest and Local Outlier Factors Classifiers respectively to see the variation given by both the Classifiers..!!
Next up is the FIFA Data Set..!! ###STAY TUNED

3. # FIFA 18 Data Set Exploration
Performed a Data Set Visualization and Found the Best XI Squad according to different positions and Formation(3-5-2,4-3-3,3-4-3...etc.)
Also went for International best squads and used Time Frames to find the Avrage Rating and Best Squad after some "n" years. Also performed Regression to find the Error and Covariance terms to find the Underrated and Overrated players in price with the variation of Ratings.

4. # Car price Prediction
Performed a Detailed Analysis over Car Modelling Data set for a Automobile Company as a Part of IIIT B assignment using Ridge and Lasso regression to find the optimal value of the Coefficient for the Model.

5. # Crop Price Prediction.
Explored a DataSet recieved from Kaggle in order to perform Price Modelling, but the data was all scattered and not suitable for modelling.Although built a XGBOOST Model which did gave a model which had the lowest RMSE score.

6. # Telecom Churn 
A Telecom company wanted to ensure to retain the customers which were more likely to Churn than investing on acquiring new customers.Hence using 3 months past data, had to predict the cutomers which were supposed to churn out in the month of September(4th Month). The models used were Logistic Regression with PCA, Random Forest with PCA and  Random Forest with all features.
Also used the XGBOOST for obtaining more better and Suitable results.

7. # Diabetes Prediction
### Project Notebook Link:
  - https://github.com/mishra-atul5001/Data-Science-and-ML-insights-Projects/blob/master/diabetes%20prediction/Diabetes%20Prediction.ipynb

### Motivation of the Project:
  - Introductory aproach towards Data Science CRISP-DM Framework in pratical use. This project enlightens towards the technology and how the same could be used to solve a real world problem of Diabetes.
 
### Libraries used:
  - sklearn -> For Modelling and evaluating Model performance
  - pandas | numpy -> For data loading and Manipulation to make it modelling ready.
  - seaborn | matplotlib -> For vizualization purpose.

### Necessary files inside the folder:
  - Ipynb notebook demonstrating the project problem statement and respective approach + solution
  - CSV file containing dataset
  - ZIP file containing the dataset CSV.

8. # GDP Analysis
Performed GDP Exploration Analysis over the DataSet from IIIT B Assignment to find out the Top States having Highest GDP and GDP Per Capita. Also, explored the features/attributes which are contributing towards the creation of GDP for the state. Categorized the States into 4 segments with Ordered Category for more Analysis.
